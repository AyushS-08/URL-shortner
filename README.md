# URL Shortener

This repository contains a URL shortener that reduces the length of URLs and tracks the number of clicks and visit history.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime used to build the application.
- **Express:** The web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database used for storing URL data.
- **Mongoose:** The ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Postman:** The API development tool used for testing and documenting the API endpoints.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** JWT is utilized to generate tokens for user authentication, providing a stateless authentication mechanism.

## Authentication

The URL Shortener also features robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure access and management of shortened URLs. Users can register for an account, log in securely, and obtain authentication tokens using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### Features:

- **User Registration:** New users can easily create an account by providing necessary information such as email and password.
- **User Authentication:** Registered users can securely log in to the application using their credentials.
- **URL Shortening:** Easily shorten long URLs to more manageable lengths.
- **Click Tracking:** Record how many times each shortened URL is clicked.
- **Visit History:** Maintain a history of visits for each shortened URL.
